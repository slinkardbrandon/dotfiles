# dotfiles

..dotfiles inspired heavily from a few other developer's configurations:

## Install Script
```
curl -sL https://github.com/slinkardbrandon/dotfiles/archive/master.tar.gz | tar xz && cd dotfiles-master && ./setup.sh
```

## Credit where it's due
- [mattorb](https://github.com/mattorb/dotfiles/blob/master/install-osx-desktop-apps.sh) - Loved the idea of a single script to set up my entire machine so much that I followed the same pattern. Also, I love tweaking OSX in several small ways into just the way I like it with the default writes.
- [joshmanders](https://github.com/joshmanders/dotfiles) - My initial inspiration for looking into dotfiles at all, several aliases and environment optimizations that I wanted to take advantage of. Also guided me to the way of dotfiling.
